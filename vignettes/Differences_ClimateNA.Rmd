`climr` currently uses the ClimateNA derived variable equations [@wang2016]. We have obtained updated parameters for number of frost free days (NFFD) and precipitation-as-snow (PAS) from the ClimateNA developers. However, there are still discrepancies between `climr` results using refmap_climatena and results from the ClimateNA product. 

Annual NFFD has discrepancies across eastern North America.

Monthly NFFD is confined to latitudinal bands within eastern North America. Note that ClimateNA has a very sharp monthly NFFD gradient in Eastern North America.

The pattern is similar for PAS. Differences in western North America are likely due our choice to disable elevation adjustment for precipitation in `climr`

It is likely that ClimateNA is using different parameters in eastern North America. We have chosen not to pursue this issue because we are planning to develop new derived variable equations for `climr` within the next year.
