`climr` facilitates downscaling to a user-provided basemap, such as the US PRISM maps. However there are several awkward elements to the process that we intend to resolve in the near future. 

1. the name of the digital elevation model (the last layer in the spatraster) is required to be "dem2_WNA".
2. it is required that `isTRUE(attr(refmap, "builder") == "climr")`. This is easily added to a user script, but it is obscure and unnecessary. 

currently a user needs two extra lines to bypass these restrictions: 

```
names(refmap_custom)[length(names(refmap_custom))] <- "dem2_WNA" # required name for the digital elevation model
attr(refmap_custom, "builder") <- "climr" # necessary to trick the package into thinking this is climr input
climr_custom <- downscale_core(points, refmap = refmap_custom, vars = list_vars(set="Monthly")) # example call to a custom refmap. 
```
