Description: This package replicate the basic approach of ClimateNA (climatena.ca),
    but with (1) improved speed, (2) cloud delivery, and (3) programmatic access via R.
    A simple downscaling method is used to bias-correct low-resolution (~100km) global
    climate model anomalies to high-resolution (2km) maps of historical climate, with
    further elevation adjustment to user-specified elevation grids/points based on
    empirical lapse rates (local relationship of climate to elevation) of the 2km
    climate maps. Elevation-adjusted monthly values of basic climate elements
    (temperature and precipitation) are then used to estimate derived variables
    (e.g., degree-days) based on published equations and parameters from 2016 Wang et al.
