Description: `climr` is an R package that builds on the downscaling concepts 
    operationalized in the ClimateNA tool (climatena.ca) (Wang et al. 2016).
    It provides downscaling of observational and simulated climate data using change-factor 
    downscaling, a simple method that adds low-spatial-resolution 
    climate anomalies to a high-spatial-resolution reference climatological map, with additional 
    elevation adjustment for temperature. Elevation-adjusted monthly values of basic climate 
    elements (temperature and precipitation) are then used to estimate derived variables 
    (e.g., degree-days) based on published equations and parameters from  Wang et al. 2016.
    `climr` is designed to be fast and to minimize local data storage requirements. To do so, 
    it uses a remote PostGIS database, and optionally caches data locally.
