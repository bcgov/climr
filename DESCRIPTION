Description: `climr` is an R package that builds on the downscaling
    concepts operationalized in the ClimateNA tool (climatena.ca) (Wang et
    al. 2016).  It provides downscaling of observational and simulated
    climate data using change-factor downscaling, a simple method that
    adds low-spatial-resolution climate anomalies to a
    high-spatial-resolution reference climatological map, with additional
    elevation adjustment for temperature. Elevation-adjusted monthly
    values of basic climate elements (temperature and precipitation) are
    then used to estimate derived variables (e.g., degree-days) based on
    published equations and parameters from Wang et al. 2016.  `climr` is
    designed to be fast and to minimize local data storage requirements.
    To do so, it uses a remote PostGIS database, and optionally caches
    data locally.
