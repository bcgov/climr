<h3 id="selection-of-the-global-climate-model-ensemble">Selection of the global climate model ensemble<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#selection-of-the-global-climate-model-ensemble"></a>
</h3>
<p>The 13 global climate models available in climr were selected by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7566" class="external-link">Mahony et al. (2022)</a> using
the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 1: Minimum of 3 historical runs available.</strong>
This criterion ensures robust bias correction. Bias correction in climr
is performed using the delta method: in which each model’s simulations
are adjusted to remove the difference (delta factor) between the
simulated and observed climate during the 1961-1990 reference period.
Calculating the delta factor from the mean of at least three simulations
reduces the confounding influence of the internal variability of
individual runs on bias correction. 44 ScenarioMIP models passed this
criterion.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 2: T<sub>min</sub> and T<sub>max</sub>
available.</strong> T<sub>min</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> are basic
climate variables for <code>climr</code>. Any models that do not provide
these variables are incompatible with <code>climr</code>. 10 models
failed this criterion. Notably, CESM2 does provide T<sub>min</sub> and
T<sub>max</sub> in their future projections, but due to an archiving
error these variables are not available for the historical runs of this
model.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 3. Complete scenarios.</strong> Models need to have
at least one simulation of each of the four major SSP marker scenarios
(SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). eight models failed this
criterion.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 4. One model per institution.</strong> This
criterion is a widely applied best practice in ensemble selection <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/29/23/jcli-d-15-0761.1.xml" class="external-link">(Leduc
et al. 2016)</a>. The rationale for each selection is provided
below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CNRM-ESM2-1 (ECS 4.8<sup>o</sup>C) was chosen over CNRM-CM6-1
(ECS 4.9<sup>o</sup>C) to give preference to the ESM over the AOGCM
configuration;</p></li>
<li><p>EC-Earth3 (ECS 4.3<sup>o</sup>C) was arbitrarily chosen over
EC-Earth3-Veg (ECS 4.3<sup>o</sup>C);</p></li>
<li><p>INM-CM5-0 (ECS 1.9<sup>o</sup>C) was arbitrarily chosen over
INM-CM4-8 (ECS 1.8<sup>o</sup>C);</p></li>
<li><p>MPI-ESM1-2-HR (ECS 3.0<sup>o</sup>C) was chosen over
MPI-ESM1-2-LR (ECS 3.0<sup>o</sup>C) due to its high resolution and
availability of &gt;1 run for all but SSP5-8.5.</p></li>
<li><p>MIROC6 (ECS 2.6<sup>o</sup>C) was chosen over MIROC-ES2L (ECS
2.7<sup>o</sup>C) because it has more runs/scenario, higher resolution,
and because the latter has very high temperature bias over British
Columbia.</p></li>
<li><p>For the purposes of this ensemble, different physics or forcing
schemes were considered different models. We used only the r*i1p3f1
variants of the GISS-E2-1-G model, as these had the most complete set of
scenario simulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criterion 5. No closely related models.</strong> Models that
share components were excluded, following Figure 5 of <a href="https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/995/2020/esd-11-995-2020.pdf" class="external-link">Brunner
et al. (2020)</a>. NESM3 was excluded due to its close relation to
MPI-ESM1.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 6. No large biases.</strong> Bias correction as
performed in climr disrupts the physical connection between climate
variables, and these distortions increase with the size of the biases in
the simulation. For this reason, models with small biases are preferable
to models with large biases, all else being equal. In an assessment over
British Columbia, the AWI-CM-1-1-MR showed extreme temperature biases
that warranted exclusion from the ensemble.</p>
<p>The 13-model ensemble has a mean global equilibrium climate
sensitivity (ECS) of 3.7<sup>o</sup>C and a range of
1.9-5.6<sup>o</sup>C, which matches the full CMIP6 ensemble ECS
(3.7<sup>o</sup>C; 1.8-5.6<sup>o</sup>C, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/26/eaba1981.full.pdf" class="external-link">Meehl
et al. 2020</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>All 13 models provided in climr are valid for analysis relative to
warming levels. However, Mahony et al. (2022) recommended a subset of 8
models for ensemble analysis, based on the following four criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 7. Constraints on equilibrium climate sensitivity
(ECS).</strong> Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the Earth’s
equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is very likely between
2<sup>o</sup>C and 5<sup>o</sup>C (Hausfather et al. 2022). The evidence
for the lower bound is robust, and weaker for the upper bound. From one
perspective, inclusion of models with ECS outside this range
uneccessarily increases the modeling uncertainty in downstream analyses.
The opposing perspective is that high-sensitivity models are useful as a
representation of high-impact, low-likelihood scenarios (<a href="https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/751/2020/" class="external-link">Sutton and
Hawkins 2020</a>). Both perspectives are valid, and the preference
depends on the objectives of each analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 8. Model resolution.</strong> Four of the climr
models are high enough resolution to resolve macrotopography e.g., to
clearly differentiate the coast mountains from the Columbia/Rocky
Mountains. This resolved macrotopography does produce
elevation-dependent climate change signals and rainshadow effects. These
models are weighted towards inclusion despite other criteria such as a
low number of simulations per scenario. Conversely, models with very low
resolution are weighted towards exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 9. Number of simulation runs.</strong> climr is
primarily designed for analysis of projected climate normals; the
climate change signal is of primary interest. Internal variability of
the models are a confounding factor, producing erratic climate change
trajectories in noisy climate variables like precipitation and winter
temperature. The signal-to-noise ratio is increased by averaging the
projected normals over multiple simulations of the same emissions
scenario. Four models (BCC, INM, GFDL, and MRI) have only one run for
most of the four scenarios, and this is a consideration for their
exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 10: Spatial pattern.</strong> IPSL-CM6A-LR has a
pronounced pattern of localized summer heating along the BC coast
ranges, and little warming in some adjacent cells. This pattern is
present for both T<sub>min</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> for all summer
months. This may be a physically credible response within the model
context, for example due to a snow albedo feedback. However, for the
purposes of <code>climr</code> it would be problematic to downscale this
warming pattern across all elevations within the cell. This problem is
not isolated to IPSL-CM6A-LR, but the cell-to-cell contrast is
especially pronounced in IPSL and could create artefacts for analyses
based on <code>climr</code>.</p>
<p>The following models are excluded based on the combination of the
four screening criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>CanESM5, because its very low horizontal resolution creates
grid-box artefacts in downscaling and because its very high climate
sensitivity (ECS 5.6<sup>o</sup>C) is also represented by
UKESM1-0-LL.</p></li>
<li><p>INM-CM5-0, because it has very low climate sensitivity (ECS
1.9<sup>o</sup>C) and is an outlier among CMIP6 models for
under-representing the observed 1975-2014 global temperature trend <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2019GL086757" class="external-link">(Liang
et al. 2020)</a>. In addition, this model has only one simulation for
most scenarios, producing a less robust climate signal.</p></li>
<li><p>BCC-CSM2-MR, due to having a single simulation for each scenario
and very low topographic resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>IPSL-CM6A-LR, due to isolated grid cells with very high summer
warming in the BC Coast Ranges. The warming in these cells may be
physically plausible (e.g., due to snow albedo feedbacks) in the model’s
simplified topography, but is problematic for downscaling to high
spatial resolution in climr.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A fifth model, UKESM1-0-LL, also has very high climate sensitivity,
similar to CanESM5, that is assessed as very unlikely based on
observational evidence. Some researchers may wish to constrain their
analysis ensemble to observations by excluding this model. Others may
wish to include this model in their ensembles as a representation of the
long tail of uncertainty in the upper limit of climate sensitivity <a href="https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/9/1155/2018/esd-9-1155-2018.pdf" class="external-link">(Sutton
2018)</a>.</p>
<p>The 8-model subset that excludes UKESM1-0 has a mean global ECS of
3.4<sup>o</sup>C (2.6-4.8<sup>o</sup>C).</p>

</h3>
<p>The differences between the 13-model and 8-model ensembles are
illustrated in Figure 1. For mean summer daily maximum temperature
(tasmax/Tmax_sm) averaged over North America, the 13-model ensemble mean
is 0.5<sup>o</sup>C (13%) warmer than the 8-model ensemble mean. The
proportional differences are greater in higher emissions scenarios
(Figure 1, top). The difference between the ensembles is roughly equal
to the difference between adjacent scenarios in mid-century (2040-2070),
but is less important than differences among scenarios later in the
century. This emphasizes that uncertainty in future emissions
overshadows the differences between the 13-model and 8-model ensemble
means.</p>
<p>The range of year-to-year variability is much greater in the 13-model
ensemble (Figure 1, bottom). This is largely due to the extreme warming
produced at high latitudes by the UKESM1-0 model. While interannual
variability of individual model runs does not affect most users of climr
(since they are averaged out in the climate normals), Figure 1 (bottom)
illustrates the importance of careful ensemble selection in analysis of
climate time series.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 13-model ensemble, like the full CMIP6 ensemble, has a mean
(3.7<sup>o</sup>C) and upper limit (5.6<sup>o</sup>C) of equilibrium
climate sensitivity that substantially exceeds the IPCC AR6 assessed
best estimate ECS of 3<sup>o</sup>C and very likely upper limit of
5<sup>o</sup>C (Arias et al. 2021). In other words, the 13-model
ensemble contains models that simulate stronger global warming than is
supported by multiple lines of observational evidence. Five (38%) of the
13 models are above the IPCC AR6 assessed likely upper limit on ECS of
4<sup>o</sup>C, and two (15%) of the models are above the very likely
upper limit of 5<sup>o</sup>C. If the ensemble were to strictly conform
to the IPCC assessed range, there would be only two models exceeding
4<sup>o</sup>C ECS and no models exceeding 5<sup>o</sup>C, following the
IPCC’s probabilistic definitions of likely (one-sided p&gt;83%) and very
likely (one-sided p&gt;95%).<br><br>
The need to reconcile the CMIP ensemble ECS range with observational
constraints is a new dilemma for climate change impacts and adaptation
researchers. It is long been agreed that model democracy (one model, one
vote) is not a strictly valid method of assessing climate change
uncertainty (Knutti 2010, Leduc et al. 2016). However, prior to CMIP6
this objection was somewhat academic since the distribution of ECS in
CMIP ensembles approximately matched the (wider) range of ECS supported
by other lines of evidence (Schmidt 2021). For practical purposes it was
reasonable for analysts to use the multimodel ensemble spread in
previous CMIP generations as a proxy for scientific uncertainty on
climate change. This approach is no longer valid given the incongruence
between the CMIP6 ensemble range of ECS and the IPCC assessed range
(Schmidt 2021). Careful model selection is now required to avoid biasing
regional climate change analyses.<br><br>
There are several viable approaches to constrain CMIP6 ensembles in
downscaled regional analyses. Weighting the models based on
observational constraints is possible for regional analyses (Ribes et
al. 2021). However, in practice many analyses will require simply
selecting a subset of the CMIP6 ensemble that is closer to the IPCC
assessed range, as we have done with the 8-model subset. The
disadvantage of this approach is that it discards valuable information
from the excluded models. The CanESM5 and UKESM1 models are advanced
models from respected modeling centers, with demonstrated skill in
modeling many Earth system processes (Eyring et al. 2021). Expressing
variables of interest relative to the amount of regional or global
warming is a widely practiced technique that facilitates inclusion of
high-ECS models by removing the timing of the warming as a factor in the
ensemble spread (Arias et al. 2021). It is conceivable that both
techniques could be used in a single study; to use the 8-model ensemble
for time-relevant analyses and a larger ensemble for analyses where the
warming level is more relevant. These considerations highlight that the
full CMIP6 ensemble is a somewhat arbitrary collection of
non-independent models, and careful ensemble selection is necessary to
achieve a meaningful representation of modeling uncertainty.</p>
