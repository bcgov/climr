<p>A gridded observational time series is a dataset that organizes
real-world measurements into a regular latitude-longitude grid and
tracks changes over time. Observations from sources like weather
stations and satellites are collected and assigned to these grid cells,
using interpolation for grid cells that do not have a direct
observation. For each grid cell, the dataset provides a continuous
record of a variable — such as temperature or precipitation — over
regular daily or monthly timesteps. The intent of gridded time series is
to allow researchers to analyze both spatial patterns and temporal
trends across large areas, even in locations without direct
observations.</p>
<p><code>climr</code> provides access to three observational time series
datasets of temperature and precipitation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>cru.gpcc</code>: The 1901-2023 combined Climatic Research Unit
TS dataset (CRU; <span class="citation">Harris et al. (<a href="#ref-harris2020cruts">2020</a>)</span>) for temperature and Global
Precipitation Climatology Centre dataset (GPCC; <span class="citation">Becker et al. (<a href="#ref-becker2013gpcc">2013</a>)</span>) for precipitation;</li>
<li>
<code>mswx.blend</code>: The 1981-2024 Multi-Source Weather (MSWX;
<span class="citation">Beck et al. (<a href="#ref-beck2022mswx">2022</a>)</span>) for temperature and
Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP; <span class="citation">Beck et al. (<a href="#ref-beck2019mswep">2019</a>)</span>) for precipitation, which we
have extended back to 1901 using the CRU/GPCC dataset; and</li>
<li>
<code>climatena</code>: The 1901-2023 ClimateNA time series (<span class="citation">Wang, Hamann, and Sang (<a href="#ref-wang2024monthly">2024</a>)</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Our aim in this article is provide a better understanding of these
datasets, including their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

</h3>
<p>Observations of historical weather are limited to data from (1)
climate stations, which are very sparse in many areas of North America,
and (2) modeled reconstructions (“reanalysis”) of historical weather
systems, which have multiple sources of bias. As a result, there is
considerable uncertainty about the past weather, and this uncertainty
varies across the landscape depending on proximity to where observations
were made. By analyzing multiple datasets with different methods and
input data, we can better understand the uncertainties in our variables
and locations of interest. Further, each dataset may be optimal for
different applications. Finally, providing multiple datasets allows
<code>climr</code> output to be benchmarked against other studies that
are based on those products.</p>

</h4>
<p>The Climatic Research Unit TS dataset uses angular distance weighting
to interpolate monthly weather station anomalies (deviations from a
long-term average). It is the only global gridded station time series
product that provides monthly mean minimum and maximum daily temperature
(Tmin and Tmax) for the entire 20th century. As a result, it is very
widely used in climate research. While CRU provides precipitation data,
independent research (<span class="citation">Sun et al. (<a href="#ref-sun2018review">2018</a>)</span>) and our own analysis
indicate that GPCC has higher performance in representing historical
precipitation. A significant weakness of both the CRU and GPCC time
series dataset is a dramatic decline in the number of stations
contributing to the datasets at the end of the 1990s (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<div id="fig1">

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="climatena">ClimateNA<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climatena"></a>
</h4>
<p>The 21st century station sparsity of the CRU and GPCC datasets (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) motivated the development of the ClimateNA
gridded monthly historical time series for North America (<span class="citation">Wang, Hamann, and Sang (<a href="#ref-wang2024monthly">2024</a>)</span>). This product uses
thin-plate splines to interpolate between weather station observations.
The North American station count from 1961-present is maintained at
above n=6000 for temperature and n=8000 for precipitation. Hence, the
ClimateNA time series do not suffer from degradation post-1990 due to
declining station density as seen in CRU and GPCC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="mswx-blend">MSWX blend<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mswx-blend"></a>
</h4>
<p>MSWX provides an entirely different approach to gridded observational
time series. Instead of interpolating between weather stations, it
applies bias correction to the hourly ERA5 reanalysis (i.e., an
observationally constrained weather model simulation) for the period
1979-present. The bias correction is performed using monthly
climatologies (30-year averages) obtained from the CHELSA product. For
precipitation, we use MSWEP, which merges multiple data sources
including rain gauge, satellite, reanalysis, and river discharge data.
We blended the MSWX/MSWEP time series with the CRU/GPCC time series to
produce a 1901-2024 time series and to allow calculation of MSWX
anomalies relative to the 1961-1990 baseline used in climr. The blend
occurs in the 1990s; hence the <code>mswx_blend</code> product is
CRU/GPCC prior to 1990, MSWX/MSWEP post-1997, and a weighted average
from 1990-1997.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="intercomparison-of-datasets">Intercomparison of datasets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intercomparison-of-datasets"></a>
</h3>
<p>The three datasets have distinct spatial patterns of anomalies,
exemplified by their 2001-2020 average Tmin anomalies across North
America (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). CRU anomalies vary at large
spatial scales due to the broad spatial influence of each station in the
distance weighting method. In contrast, the MSWX blend exhibits
localized anomalies that follow physiographic features such as the
MacKenzie Mountains in southern Yukon, the Great Lakes, and the coastal
fringe in the Pacific Northwest. This link to physiographic features is
an outcome of using a physical weather model as the basis for MSWX.
Finally, the ClimateNA time series exhibits credible spatial detail in
station-dense United States, but also has spatial oscillations in
station-sparse western and northern Canada that may be artefacts of the
thin-plate spline method of interpolation between stations.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The general difference between datasets noted in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> are also evident in Tmax anomalies and
different months (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3a</a>). Specifically: the
higher spatial detail of the MSWX-blend and climateNA time series; and
the apparent interpolation artefacts in station-sparse regions of the
climateNA time series, most visible in Central Mexico.</p>
<p>For precipitation, the three products indicate similar trends at a
very coarse contintental scale, but there are substantial differences
between the precipitation trends at regional scales (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3b</a>). MSWX-blend has the highest spatial detail
and appears generally credible. It also exhibits the strongest trends,
with adjacent 20-year anomalies of a factor of two (-50%, +100%) in the
arctic. These strong contrasting trends may be artefacts, but we have
not yet investigated their credibility.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The striking differences between the three products are further
evident in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, which shows 1961-2020 February
Tmin trends in British Columbia and Alberta. The quality-controlled
station records from the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data
(<span class="citation">Vincent, Hartwell, and Wang (<a href="#ref-vincent2020ahccd">2020</a>)</span>) are provided for
reference. The CRU time series indicates a moderate cooling across
northern BC while the MSWX blend indicates a moderate warming; both
trends are stronger than the relatively neutral station trends. The
ClimateNA product has strongly contrasting warming and cooling trends
that are not supported by the AHCCD stations. We have not yet
established whether this pattern is due to non-AHCCD stations or is an
artefact of the spline interpolation in areas with no stations. The
variation among the stations themselves indicates the significant
uncertainty in determining regional climate change trends.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Okanagan Valley (outlined with the black rectangle in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) has a high density of AHCCD stations that
help to put the differences between the gridded products into context.
The CRU and ClimateNA time series are very similar during the 20th
century, but diverge in 1998 coincident with the sharp decline in CRU
station density (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). This divergence produces
a slight cooling trend in CRU and a slight warming trend in ClimateNA.
The 6 AHCCD stations corroborate the CRU trend, as indicated by the
boxplot. However, the year-to-year variability is much greater than the
difference in the trends, and is synchronous between the products.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The July temperature time series is instructive (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). The post-1998 divergence of the products is
much greater relative to natural variability. Unlike in February, the
CRU trend is below the distribution of AHCCD station trends. This
example illustrates that the differences between products is not trivial
and could have substantial implications both for trend detection and
analysis of interannual variation. The February and July examples
illustrate that one product doesn’t necessarily provide a consistently
more reliable trend, even in station-dense regions.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To assess the general reliability of the gridded products, we
assessed error in the 2001-2020 mean temperature anomalies relative to
the AHCCD stations across western Canada (west of -100<sup>o</sup>E,
including the Arctic region)(<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). The
limitation of this approach is that it favours station based products
(CRU and ClimateNA) because they use some or all AHCCD stations as input
data. Further, this assessment doesn’t provide insights on the quality
of interpolation between stations.</p>
<p>CRU consistently has the lowest range of error, but it consistently
has a median error below zero indicating that on average CRU
underestimates the climate change trend in both Tmin and Tmax. ClimateNA
overestimates the trend in non-summer Tmin and underestimates the trend
in summer Tmax. Across all months, the MSWX blend has the least bias in
trend, though ClimateNA also has low bias in Tmax.</p>

<p>The results across western Canada suggest that the MSWX blend has
lower bias than the other two products. However, results for individual
provinces indicates that this lower bias is not consistent among regions
(<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>). There is no consistently preferable
product across regions and months, in terms of trend error relative to
AHCCD stations. Again, this is a narrow comparison that inherently
favours CRU and ClimateNA.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusions"></a>
</h3>
<p>This cursory analysis has not identified a clear winner among gridded
observational time series. CRU/GPCC are compromised by the post-1990s
decline in station density, while ClimateNA exhibits apparent
interpolation artefacts with large impacts on the detected climate
change trend. the MSWX blend produces credible trends for temperature
and precipitation, but has likely artefacts in precipitation trends in
the arctic. The MSWX blend is the most conceptually appealing approach
to gridded time series because the gridpoints without station
observations are informed by physical weather modeling. However, a more
detailed validation would be required to establish MSWX as a preferred
product. In the meantime, we are using the MSWX-blend for the 2001-2020
observed normals (`obs_periods = “2001_2020”) as well as for
transferring the 1981-2010 climr climatological mosaic to the 1961-1990
baseline period.</p>
<p>Some further considerations for users of gridded time series in
<code>climr</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>None of the products are reliable for detection of climate change
trends. Where possible, it is preferable to use quality-controlled
station data such as AHCCD (<span class="citation">Vincent, Hartwell,
and Wang (<a href="#ref-vincent2020ahccd">2020</a>)</span>) for trend
analysis. We intend to include AHCCD station data in a future version of
climr. Where gridded observational time series are used, it is a good
practice to include all three datasets as a (crude) way of representing
uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>The blending of MSWX with CRU/GPCC is necessary because climr
uses a 1961-1990 baseline, while MSWX is only available for 1979 to
present. Nevertheless, this blending likely contaminates the MSWX time
series with artefacts from the CRU time series. We will investigate
better ways of integrating reanalysis time series into climr.</p></li>
<li><p>The differences between the datasets are most salient for trend
detection. In noisy variables such as precipitation and winter
temperatures, interannual climatic variability appears to be generally
synchronous and much greater than the trend.</p></li>
